About the notebooks
==================
[Pluto.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) notebooks provide a great opportunity to put together code, text and graphics 
in a reproducible and accessible way. Therefore, the examples for this package are provided as Pluto notebooks.
Like the example code, the notebook code is tested during CI.

Plese note, that in the html version, interactive elements like sliders are disabled. Navigation via the table of contents does work, though.
